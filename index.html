        Hash tables are convenient in allowing lookup of data in a fixed amount of time. 
        However, this assumes the input is a fixed size. What if the input size varies? 
        The time taken by any hash function is dependent on the size of the input.
        <br><br>
        How, then, can we guarantee that the hash will take a constant amount of time? 
        That’s what I aimed for with this project.
        <br><br>
        To ensure the hash is generated in O(1) time, only a fixed amount of samples can be
        taken. In this case, 8 bytes are selected from the file.
        <br><br>
        How are the sample indexes decided? The input is divided into 8 segments, and 
        the sample is taken from a pseudo-random spot in each segment.
        <br><br>
        Next, each sample is xored with a mask value hard-coded into the function. These 
        masks are 7-digit primes. The result is then added to a sum value.
        <br><br>
        Once done, the sum is multiplied by a large prime to magnify small changes. Each 
        sample is xored with this sum, ensuring a “butterfly effect” in the hash output.
        <br><br>
        We see the constant-time nature of the function reflected in time trials. Here’s 
        a comparison of time taken to hash a .txt file containing the character “a”, and 
        a hash of the function’s own source code.

        Additionally, here’s the time taken to produce a hash for the

        The time-complexity and relatively small filesize would make this ideal for 
        embedded systems, or other applications with limited time and resources.
        <br><br>
        This being said, it does have some shortcomings. For one, because the file is sampled in 
        only 8 places, finding collisions would be relatively easy. This (or any constant-time 
        hash function) should not be used in any place where security is critical.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, the function is not proven in any way to be mathematically sound. There is 
        no guarantee that all outputs are equally likely, or that every output is possible. The 
        output appears to be random from the limited tests I’ve done, although it’s unlikely 
        there isn’t some sort of underlying pattern.
        <br><br>
        Lastly, some indexes will get sampled multiple times with inputs larger than 8 bytes. 
        This is a bug I hope to iron out in future versions.
